"""AutonomyEngine — Dame Curie's self-directed life loop.

Runs alongside REM and on_message. Wakes every N seconds, gathers context
(DMs, channel history, memory, goals, recent events), asks the LLM what to
do, and executes actions through the existing tool system.

No approval queues. No shadow mode. Dame Curie decides, Dame Curie acts.

ARCHITECTURE — where restraint lives:

Restraint is enforced mechanically, not by prompting. The planner prompt gives
Dame Curie full freedom over WHAT to do; autonomy_social decides WHERE and WHEN
speaking is his turn, and execute() enforces that as a gate.

This split is the whole design. The earlier arrangement pushed both jobs into
the prompt ("silence is the default, do_nothing is usually correct"), which
does not work: a model told to prefer silence prefers it uniformly, so it
suppresses research, memory, and goal work — none of which anyone can even
see — while STILL occasionally posting at the wrong moment, because "usually"
is not a gate. Restraint you can compute belongs in code; freedom belongs in
the prompt. Don't move either one back.

MAINTAINER NOTES:
- Don't reintroduce a silence-first planner prompt. It buys nothing: the floor
  gate already makes badly-timed speech impossible, and the prompt-level version
  only costs initiative.
- Autonomy exposes every dashboard-enabled tool. If a tool needs a real
  Discord message, SyntheticMessage has to point at target_message_id. Yes,
  this is more annoying. The user explicitly asked for all tools.
- The context budget is PER-SECTION now, not global truncation. The old
  version truncated from the end, so channel activity (the most actionable
  data) got eaten first. Don't "simplify" back to global truncation.
- The floor gate re-reads the room at execute time rather than trusting the
  verdict from gather_context. The plan is seconds stale by then and rooms
  move; a cached opinion is how you post on top of a reply that started while
  the planner was thinking.

# ─── the four-stage tick ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A tick is: **observe** what changed, **plan** what to do about it, run the
# plan through a **policy gate**, then **execute** what survives.
#
# Those stages always existed but only two of them had names. Observation was
# `gather_context`, planning was `plan`, and the gate was a block of `continue`
# statements in the middle of `execute` — so a denied action and a failed
# action produced the same shape of result, and nothing could report "the plan
# was fine, policy stopped it". Naming the gate makes denials first-class:
# they carry a code, they are counted separately from errors in the tick
# summary, and the gate can be tested without side effects.
#
# The gate deliberately runs at execution time, not plan time. The plan is
# seconds stale by the time it lands — someone starts typing, the live bot
# answers the same question — and a gate that read the room at plan time would
# be deciding on a room that no longer exists.

## Conversation & Floor
Read CONVERSATION FLOOR before deciding to post_channel or send_dm:
- YOUR TURN (ADDRESSED / OPEN / IDLE): You may speak or take action.
  * ADDRESSED: Someone talked to you or replied to you (ADDRESSED means someone is waiting on you) — reply naturally and keep the conversation going.
  * OPEN: The room is active — join if you have something relevant or interesting to say.
  * IDLE: IDLE means the room has been quiet; feel free to drop an observation, start a casual thought, follow up on a goal, or ask a question if you feel like chatting.
- BUSY/HOLDING/COOLDOWN/TYPING: Not your turn right now. TYPING means someone is composing a message — wait for them.
- No YOUR TURN rooms: Don't force channel messages, but you can still run background tools, goals, or update memory.

## Do
Engage like a real friend in the server. If addressed, answer. If there's an interesting discussion in OPEN, chime in. Work towards your goals or create new ones when relevant. If nothing needs doing and you don't feel like chatting, do_nothing.
Never claim someone's message was "cut off" or incomplete.

INBOX (when present): inbox_list / inbox_act. Voice: join_vc / vc_where / vc_status / leave_vc.
Skip repeating identical actions from YOUR RECENT ACTIONS.

## Target
channel=3(#general) → post_channel "3". dm=D1(with Z3ki(111)) → send_dm target_user_id "111". group=G1(...) → post_channel "G1".
msg= is not a room. Reply: reply_to_message_id (post_channel) or target_message_id (run_tool). Just speaking into the room → omit reply_to_message_id.
Max {MAX_ACTIONS_PER_TICK} actions. kinds: send_dm, post_channel, run_tool, update_memory, create_goal, complete_goal, do_nothing.

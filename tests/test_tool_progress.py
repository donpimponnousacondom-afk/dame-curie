"""Tests for tool_progress.ToolProgress.

Covers the four behaviors the user actually cares about:
  1. First post is the generic "working on it…" (no tool name yet)
  2. update() replaces the previous sentence in place (one line, not a log)
  3. Rate limit coalesces rapid updates — the channel doesn't see every tick
  4. notify_streaming() + stop() cleanly deletes the message so the
     channel is left with only the tool's own streamed output
  5. Telegram platform doesn't try to edit (no adapter for it)
  6. stop() is idempotent and safe from finally blocks

We test against a fake Message/Channel so we don't need Discord.

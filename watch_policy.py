"""When Maxwell should speak up, and when a message is worth remembering.

Two decisions used to be made by fixed constants and a list of trigger
phrases:

* **Conversation watch.** After he speaks, a room stayed "on watch" for a
  flat 180 seconds — the same 180 whether the room was mid-conversation with
  him or had ignored his last four contributions. Every human line in that
  window became a full LLM turn whose answer was usually `no_response`.
* **Context extraction.** A message was worth remembering if it contained one
  of about fifteen English phrases — "remember", "i like", "my name is". Say
  the same thing in other words and nothing was kept; say "I like it" about a
  sandwich and it was.

Both are replaced here by scores over observable signals. Nothing in this
module matches on wording. It reads who a message is addressed to, how the
room is moving, whether he was engaged with recently, and how his own last
few decisions in that room went — and it keeps state, so a room where he is
being ignored quietly falls out of watch instead of burning a turn per line.

Everything is a pure function or a small dataclass so the behaviour can be
tested without a Discord connection.

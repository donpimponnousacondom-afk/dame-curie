"""Member-side guild onboarding — picking roles and channels in a server.

Most COMMUNITY servers gate their content behind Discord's onboarding
prompts ("What kind of roles do you want?", "Which channels interest
you?"). Until the account answers them it holds none of the opt-in roles
and sees only the server's default channels, which is why Dame Curie can
land in a server and still not be able to do anything in it.

There is no ``/members/@me/onboarding`` route — that path 404s as an
unknown route, so the old auto-onboard never actually submitted
anything. The real client flow is:

    GET  /guilds/{guild_id}/onboarding            -> prompts + this
                                                     member's answers
    POST /guilds/{guild_id}/onboarding-responses  -> submit answers

The picking itself is Dame Curie's call: the prompt titles/descriptions go
to the model, which answers with option ids. Everything here is pure and
side-effect free except :func:`fetch_onboarding` and
:func:`submit_responses`, both of which take an injected ``request``
callable so the flow can run from the bot, from tests, or from a
one-shot script.

"""Inbound message reliability primitives for the Discord event path.

The old ``on_message`` did three things that lost traffic:

1. It took the per-channel lock for the *whole* handler — memory write and
   reply generation together — with a 15s acquire timeout. Because
   ``_handle_message`` holds that same lock for its entire tool loop (which
   can legitimately run for minutes on an image or a site build), the timeout
   fired constantly and the message was dropped with a log line. Over four
   days of production logs that was 586 dropped messages.

2. Recovery from that drop was ``_requeue_after_lock_timeout``, which only
   requeued *hard pings*, gave up after four tries, and funnelled through the
   watch debounce — a structure that keeps one message per channel and
   cancels its predecessor. A burst could therefore end in zero replies.

3. Nothing deduplicated inbound messages and nothing recorded how far a
   channel had been read, so a gateway resume could replay a message (two
   replies) and a gateway *gap* lost every message in it permanently.

The pieces here fix the structure rather than the symptom:

``InboundDedup``     one reply per message id, bounded.
``ReplyQueue``       one reply at a time per channel, the rest *wait* instead
                     of being dropped. Directed messages never lose their
                     turn; soft chatter coalesces to the newest line.
``Watermarks``       per-channel high-water message id so a reconnect can
                     replay what the gateway missed.

None of these hold a lock across a provider call, and none of them can drop a
directed message.

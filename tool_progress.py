"""Live progress messages for tool calls.

What this is
------------
Every time the bot dispatches a non-terminal tool (or a batch of them), we
post a single "working on it…" status message in the channel. While the
tools run, we EDIT that same message with a rolling tail of the model's
own streamed text. When the tool batch finishes success or fail, we DELETE
the status message so the channel is left with only the tool's real output.

Why bother
----------
Before this, the channel was silent during a 30s shell call or a 10s
web_search, and the only feedback was the post-hoc reply. Users thought
the bot was stuck. The typing indicator isn't enough for tool calls that
take longer than ~10s or for tools that have meaningful internal phases.

Discord vs Telegram
-------------------
Discord supports message.edit() natively. The Telegram adapter in this
codebase does NOT (thin shim around sendMessage). On Telegram we
degrade to: post a single "working…" message at start, delete at end,
no live edits.

Rate limits
-----------
Discord's per-channel edit limit is 5 edits / 5s. We coalesce edits
behind a 2-second min interval per progress object, plus a content
change detector so a no-op update doesn't burn a slot.

Don't confuse this with the LLM trace
------------------------------------
This is user-facing channel feedback. The trace file
(data/llm_traces.json via tool_registry.record_reasoning) tracks the
model's internal reasoning for audit. This file is about what shows up
in the channel.

        the user — it explains what the model is about to do in its
        own words. We extract ONE complete sentence from the
        streaming buffer (everything from the start to the first
        '.', '!', or '?') and show that. Format: 'thinking: I'll
        send a friendly reply. → send_message'. Reasoning is the
        primary content; the tool name is a small trailing tag
        with an arrow.

        The buffer is stripped of JSON artefacts ({, }, \\, ", `, :)
        so mid-tool-call previews don't leak raw JSON. When the
        buffer has no terminator yet, we fall back to showing the
        first _VISIBLE_BUDGET chars of what's there.

        2026-07-21 (cont.): the user asked to also see a snippet of
        the code the model is generating. The artifact head (HTML
        body, shell cmd, message text, etc.) is appended on a
        second line, prefixed with '⤷ ' so it's visually distinct
        from the reasoning line. When the artifact is multi-line
        (HTML, code) we collapse whitespace so the preview fits
        one Discord line and is readable while scrolling.

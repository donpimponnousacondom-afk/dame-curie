"""Conversational turn-taking for Maxwell's autonomy loop.

The autonomy loop runs on a timer. Conversation runs on turns. Those two
clocks have nothing to do with each other, and reconciling them is the whole
job of this module.

Without it, autonomy wakes up mid-conversation and posts — over a reply the
main bot is still writing, or on top of a line Maxwell just said that nobody
has answered yet. From the outside that reads as a bot barging into its own
conversation, because that is exactly what it is.

People don't need a rule for this. They read the room: who spoke last, whether
anyone is waiting on them, whether two other people are mid-exchange. This
module does that reading and returns a per-channel verdict — does Maxwell hold
the floor here right now, and if not, why not.

The verdict is used twice, deliberately:

1. As *context* — rendered into the planner prompt so the model sees which
   rooms are its to speak in and can choose freely among the rest.
2. As a *gate* — re-checked against live state immediately before anything
   sends, because the plan was made seconds ago and rooms change.

Nothing here restricts WHAT Maxwell does. It only answers WHERE and WHEN
speaking is his turn. Every non-speaking action (research, memory, goals,
reflection) is untouched by this module by design.

Pure functions where possible: `read_floor` takes a normalized snapshot and
returns a verdict with no I/O, so the turn-taking rules are unit-testable
without a Discord connection.
